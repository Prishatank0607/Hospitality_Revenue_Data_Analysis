# Hospitality_Revenue_Data_Analysis

## Overview

**Hospitality_Revenue_Data_Analysis** is a comprehensive project in the hospitality revenue domain. The dataset for this project was gathered from **CodeBasics**, and the analysis was conducted using **Power BI** to provide actionable insights and address revenue challenges faced by AtliQ Grands, a chain of luxury hotels in India.

The project focuses on analyzing historical data to create key metrics and visualizations that help the revenue management team improve decision-making and regain market share.


## Features

### Data Preparation and Modeling

- Imported and verified the dataset for accuracy.
- Applied transformations and created a data model suitable for revenue analysis.

### Metrics Development

- Created **26 key performance indicators (KPIs)** using DAX, including:
  - **RevPAR** (Revenue per Available Room)
  - **Occupancy %**
  - **ADR** (Average Daily Rate)
  - **Realization %**
  - **DSRN**, **DBRN**, **DURN** (Daily Booked Room Night, Daily Sellable Room Nights, Daily Utilized Room Nights)
  - **Cancellation %**
  - **Average Rating**

### Dashboard Development

- Designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** based on stakeholder-provided mock-ups.
- Utilized visualizations such as:
  - **Calendar visuals** to analyze daily revenue trends by week and month.
  - **KPI cards** for quick performance metrics overview.
  - **Bar charts**, **line graphs**, and **treemaps** for deeper insights.

### New Techniques Learned

- Understanding hospitality-specific KPIs (e.g., **RevPAR**, **ADR**, **Occupancy**).
- Using a **calendar visual** to analyze revenue trends on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
- Creating a **“weekend-weekday” calculated column**, extracting week numbers, and day names from the date column for advanced filtering.

### Insights Generation

- Identified trends not included in the mock-up, such as:
  - **Revenue variations by seasonality**.
  - **Performance comparison between weekend and weekday bookings**.
  - **Cancellation rate impact** on overall revenue.
